# lacemarket-scraping

A webscraping project to get data on secondhand dress sales from the popular resale site Lacemarket and the very useful dress catalog site Lolibrary. Data collected includes characteristics such as original price, resale price, brand, style, etc. Built in R using rvest.

Order of files to run:
1) scrapedata.R
2) betterdata.R

Other files are either the data frames produced by the R code saved to a csv, or plots to help visualize the data that was collected.
